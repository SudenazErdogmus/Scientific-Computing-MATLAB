Covering some basic topics I haven't seen elsewhere on Cody.

Given an input matrix, generate an output matrix that consists of the input matrix replicated in a 2 by 2 pattern Examples:

[1] -> [1 1
        1 1]
[1 2       -> [1 2 1 2
 3 4]          3 4 3 4 
               1 2 1 2 
               3 4 3 4]
